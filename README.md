# ZtnDataCleansing
This repo contains dockerfiles and docker compose files for a research project for the CYB 330 (Networking and Control Systems) course at the University of Idaho. It explores the effect that data cleansing has on the decision making of a zero touch networking ML model when training on cleansed and uncleased data. See the Readme for more detail.
